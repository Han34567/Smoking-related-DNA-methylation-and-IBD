# Smoking-related-DNA-methylation-and-IBD
This study aimed to explore biological pathways by which smoking may be involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). We first conducted a prospective cohort study and a Mendelian randomization study to examine the association of smoking behaviors and related DNA methylation with Crohnâ€™s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) risks. Then, we performed a IBD EWAS and colocalization analysis to validate our findings before.
